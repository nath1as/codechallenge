# React App Code Challenge

## Matija Potocnik Pribosic

## Deployed on:

https://affectionate-villani-636245.netlify.app

## Difficulties:

- the api key provided in the instructions did not work
- a warning about key uniqueness on the first render is tough to get rid off
- would work better with more preloading
